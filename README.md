# EX_04_Wireframe Design for a Generic Application Using Balsamiq

## Aim:

To design a wireframe diagram for a generic application or website using Balsamiq, including five essential screens:

## Algorithm:

1. Identify Requirements: Define the target audience, app purpose, and user flow.

2. Choose Screen Components: For each screen, determine what elements (buttons, forms, images, text) are necessary.

3. Use Balsamiq Tool: Open Balsamiq and create a new project. Drag and drop required UI components for each screen.

4. Maintain Consistency: Apply consistent layout, spacing, and navigation patterns across all five screens.

5. Review & Export: Verify the layout for clarity and usability, then export the wireframes as images or PDF


## Output:

## Result:

Wireframes for five essential application screens were successfully created using Balsamiq. These low-fidelity mockups helped visualize the layout and functionality of the user interface, serving as a blueprint for future UI development and user testing.
